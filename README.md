# Alarm Clock
This is a simple alarm clock implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook. It allows you to set an alarm time and plays a sound when the alarm time is reached.
## Prerequisites
To run this code, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install it using Anaconda or by following the official Jupyter Notebook installation guide: https://jupyter.org/install
## Getting Started
1. Download and save the `alarm_clock.ipynb` notebook file to your local machine.
2. Prepare an alarm sound file (e.g., `sound.mp3`) and place it in the same directory as the `alarm_clock.ipynb` file.
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook on your machine.
4. Open the `alarm_clock.ipynb` notebook file using Jupyter Notebook.
5. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially by pressing Shift + Enter.
6. When prompted, enter the desired alarm time in the format `HH:MM`.
7. The program will continuously check the current time and compare it with the entered alarm time.
8. When the alarm time is reached, it will display "Wake up!" and play the alarm sound specified in the notebook.
## Customization
- You can replace the `sound.mp3` file in the same directory with your preferred alarm sound file. Ensure that the file is in a compatible audio format (e.g., MP3, WAV).
- Feel free to modify the code in the notebook to add more features, such as snooze functionality or different alarm sounds.
## Dependencies
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.x
